            <p>Playing clash since 2015.As a result , I was able to become #8 highest trophies record holder in townhall 8 division.
Now I m pushing townhall 15 ids , and in some seasons I rank among top 1000 . I need to improve my skills furthermore . This will help  for players with good offenses and weak defences to reach top. I like to share this with players who hope to become real LEGENDS.</p><span>This is about me.
